    <p>Email remains one of the most widely used communication tools, but its security has not always kept pace with modern threats. In 2025, with growing concerns about data breaches, AI phishing, and identity theft, the importance of secure email is greater than ever.</p>

    <h2>üîê What is Secure Email?</h2>
    <p>Secure email refers to messages that are encrypted so only the intended recipient can read them. This often involves the use of encryption technologies such as PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions), and TLS (Transport Layer Security).</p>

    <h2>üí° Why It Matters in 2025</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>AI-based phishing attacks are more advanced and difficult to detect.</li>
      <li>Email is increasingly used for identity verification (2FA, login alerts, financial services).</li>
      <li>Using a secure and personal email address improves your digital presence and credibility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üöÄ Getting Started</h2>
    <p>To get started with secure email, choose a provider that supports end-to-end encryption, offers spam filtering, and includes advanced authentication options like two-factor authentication.</p>

    <blockquote>
      "Email is your digital front door. Secure it before someone else walks through it."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to reduce the risk of spoofing, and enable PGP or S/MIME if available. Always be cautious of suspicious links or unexpected attachments.</p>
